"""Arithmetic Operators"""

# Arithmetic operations are performed using the following operators: 
# +, -, *, / (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), ** (exponent), % (modulus), // (floor division)

a = 10
b = 5.5

# TODO: Write an addition operation using the above variables.
addition = a+b
print(addition)

# TODO: Write a subtraction operation using the above variables.
subtraction = a-b
print(subtraction)

# TODO: Write a multiplication operation using the above variables.
multiplication = a*b
print(multiplication)

# ----------------------------------------------

"""Comparison operators"""

# Comparison operators are used to compare two values. The result of a comparison is a Boolean value (True or False).

x = 100
y = 100

# TODO: Write an equal to comparison using the above variables.
equal = a==b
print("is equal to", equal)

# TODO: Write a not equal to comparison using the above variables.
not_equal = a!=b
print("is not equal to", not_equal)

# TODO: Write a greater than comparison using the above variables.
greater_than = a>b
print("is greater than", greater_than)

# TODO: Write a less than or equal to comparison using the above variables.
less_or_equal = a<=b
print("is less than or equal to", less_or_equal)

# ----------------------------------------------

"""Logical operators"""

# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. The result of a logical operation is a Boolean value (True or False).

# TODO: Write a logical AND operation using True and False.
logical_and = True and False
print(logical_and)

# TODO: Write a logical OR operation using True and False.
logical_or = True or False
print(logical_or)

# TODO: Write a logical NOT operation using True.
logical_not = not True
print(logical_not)

# ----------------------------------------------

"""Identity operators"""

# Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. The result of an identity operation is a Boolean value (True or False).
a = 1
b = 20

# TODO: Write an IS identity comparison using the above variables.
is_same = a is b
print(is_same)

# TODO: Write a IS NOT identity comparison using the above variables.
is_not_same = a is not b
print(is_not_same)

# ----------------------------------------------

"""Membership operators"""

# Membership operators are used to test whether a sequence is presented in an object. The result of a membership operation is a Boolean value (True or False).

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]  # List datatype

# TODO: Write an IN membership operation to check if a is in my_list.
is_in_list = ...
print(is_in_list)

# TODO: Write a NOT IN membership operation to check if b is not in my_list.
is_not_in_list = ...
print(is_not_in_list)
